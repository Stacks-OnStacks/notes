# SDLC & Agile

## SDLC

SDLC stands for Software Development Lifecycle, a methodology with clearly defined processes.

-   Primary goal: create high-quality software and lowest cost in the shortest possible time
-   Provides a well structured flow of phases that helps and organization quickly produce a goal
-   Makes sure it's well tested and ready for production
-   6 Phases of SDLC:
    -   Requirement Analysis
    -   Planning
    -   Software Design, Architecture (skeleton code)
    -   Software Development
    -   Testing
    -   Deployment

## Waterfall

-   Old school approach, still in practice
-   **NOT** inherently bad
-   Far more restrict procedure
-   Idea, is you're following a plan _EXACTLY_ to the T based on documentation
-   Example:
    -   Making a Helicopter or a Plane, you need make that when you're building you don't replace any component with something that "might" do the job. Computer when you steering you don't want to bank left when you're trying to go right

## Agile

-   Mindset/Philosophy
-   There are NO specific rules
-   Core beliefs that you should adapt
    -   being _agile_ in your approach to problems
    -   being quick to come up with solutions
-   Four main tenets about agile
    -   **Adapt** to change OVER following a plan
    -   **Customer Collaboration** OVER contracts
    -   **Communication** OVER Procedure
    -   **Demo** OVER Documentation

## Agile-Scrum

-   Implementation of the Agile Philosophy
-   Based on iterative sprints
    -   Typically between 2-4 weeks
-   Key Roles:
    -   **Product Owner**
        -   Person Ultimately incharege of the success of a project
    -   **Scrum Master**
        -   Leads a scrum team (King of the Scrumlings) and their job is to acheive peak efficieny
    -   **Scrumlings (Team Memebers)**
        -   these are all the developers in the scrum working on the project
-   **KEY CEREMONIES**
    -   **Storyboarding/Sprint Planning**
    -   **Daily Standup**
    -   **Sprint Review**
    -   **Sprint Retrospective**
    -   **Backlog Refine**

# User Story

-   in most agile approaches you approach them by building software form the prospective of the user
-   Planning a feature
    -   **AS A** employee **I WANT TO** view pending order **SO THAT** I can start making the order.
    -   **Feature Sprawl**
        -   writing some feature or implementation that no one really requested
        -   IF you're done with your feature ASK OTHERS if they need anything or look at the backlog
-   **MVP**
    -   MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
    -   Make sure your user stories that were asked for are hit first
    -   After this is achevied you can head into the depths of google for some crazy ideas
-   **Pointing**
    -   Assigning a difficulty level to the task of a user story
    -   Commonly: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    -   If too large a number for difficulty you might want to consider breaking it apart
    -   Alternatives:
        -   xs, s, m, l, xl, xxl
        -   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 (Fibbonacci)

## Agile-Kanban

-   popular framework used to implemenet agile
-   requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work
-   Gives the team:
    -   More flexibility to plan out options
    -   Faster output
    -   Clearer focus
-   All you need for this implementation is "cards"

## Kanban Board

-   Everything revolves aroundt his board.
-   Helps visualize work and optimization flow amungst team members
-   Plethora of virtual boards to allow for agile-kanban - Traceability - Ease of collaboration - Accessibility from multiple locations - Full transparency of your work and real-time communication

# Daily Standups!

-   I finished: X, Y, Z
-   I plan to work on : A, B, C
-   I have a roadblock: 1, 2, 3, 4

-   For example:

Charles Jester

-   I finished: with the agile-sdlc demo
-   I plan to work on: more terminal and java commands
-   I have a roadblock: nothing, so far smooth sailing

Khalis Bell

-   I finished: building a skeleton
-   I plan to work on: Implementation of DevOps
-   I has a roadblock: I have no idea what DevOps even is (this is where your team members step in - offering assistance or resources)
