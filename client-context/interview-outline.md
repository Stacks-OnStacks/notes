## Round 2 - Live Coding Challenge:

-   [Top 50 most common coding interview challenges
    ](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/07/top-50-java-programs-from-coding-Interviews.html)
-   Make a method to determine if a number is prime
-   code a linked list
-   make some class and use that as a key in a Map
-   write a method that can return true if 2 2s are next to each other in an - array
    -   [1,2,2] -> true
    -   [2,1,2] -> false
-   create an immutable class ...
    -   Refactor immutable class if they find a possible loophole
-   Write query find an employee inside an employee table, salary greater than 100k order by department (SQL)

Example notepad:

1. define an array;
2. define a 2-dimensional array
3. populate them
4. use a loop to populate them
5. use a loop to print all the elements in a 2-dimensional array
6. find the max value in an int array

#### Potential Logic & Critical Thinking

-   How would you go about creating an application to play a game of chess in Java?
-   How would you implement spell check, in something like notepad, in Java?

## Common Good Feedback

Round 1

-   Appreciated strong communication skills!!!
-   Really Personable
-   Tied experiences both past and present into their goals & skills
-   Ability to Articulate work on project!

Round 2

-   Spent the time to figure out the question first before immediately tackling it with code.
-   Talked through what they were implementing as the wrote it
-   Figured out a unique approach
-   Was able to communicate about alternative solutions
-   Able to express more efficient solutions

## Common Bad Feedback

Round 1

-   Communication is shaky
-   Couldn't elaborate on expereinces outside of revature
-   Did not clearly explain technical contributinos when asked about group projects
    -   only focused on discussing about helping others and debugging
-   Short responses lacking details
    -   Constantly forced to ask follow up questions
    -   "like pulling teeth"

Round 2

-   Did not get to code, spent entire hour trying to figure out the algorithm step-by-step
-   Went well past the hour time limit
-   Could solve problem theoretically, trouble implementing into code
-   Inability to debug and identify errors with their application
